# Cyber Security Internship – Task 1

This repository contains my submission for Task 1 of the Cyber Security Internship.

In this task, I learned the fundamentals of cyber security, including the CIA triad,
types of cyber attackers, attack surfaces, OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities,
and basic application data flow.

This task helped me build a strong foundation in cyber security concepts.
